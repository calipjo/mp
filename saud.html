I believe it is one of the best viewdeck to witness how the sun start its duty in daytime and automatically find a resting place when the moon are ready to come in. Since we missed the sunset we found the place too huge for a limited number of tourists. Maybe they got tired of all-day swimming and back to their hotel for rest. Well, this is what we want to do in all our beach-hopping–walk, run, swim and enjoy without worrying if other people will look at our kiddie-like behavior. .Saud Beach is one of unspoiled beach in the Philippines and very popular in Ilocos province. They fondly called it as “Boracay of the North” because of its pristine water, long-stretch sand with coconut and palm trees on the beachfront but I think Pagudpud has its unique identity and already a paradise itself.Unlike in Boracay where there is ongoing night party , you can find here in Saud the chilling effect of being away from bustling city noise. Only the wave of the sea or the soft whooping of people around will echoed in your ear. Even the beautiful sky is so amazing to look at.
