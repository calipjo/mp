   <h2 style="padding: 5%;"><p>Pagudpud is located in the province of Ilocos Norte, home to many picturesque beaches and a gateway to nearby islands. The best way to access Pagudpud is by bus, which is a reliable and fairly comfortable process, important to note as the city is about 12 hours away from Manila.<br>
   <br>
    One of the most famous beaches in the country, perhaps the whole region, is located within the municipality of Pagudpud. A longtime favorite among movie producers and others in the media, Saud Beach is a picturesque stretch of an idyllic beach scene that has found its way to a lot of silver screens. Because this beach is on almost everyone’s must-see list, it’s almost always crowded and more expensive than other beaches in the area. Of course there are also many hotels and resorts dotted alongside Saud Beach, so travelers have the option of snagging one of those rooms for the perfect beachfront vacation.

    Along the shoreline, overlooking the sea and partly joined by the Bantay Abot caves is the Timmangtang Rock, which is a great vantage point from which to enjoy stunning views of the sea and surrounding area. The climb to the top of the rock isn’t too difficult as the rock itself is fairly covered with greenery, perfect even for camping or picnics at the top of the rock while enjoying the breathtaking views.

    Pagudpud has a great deal to offer any traveler, and even more so to those who prefer to spend their vacations near the sea.</p></h2>
